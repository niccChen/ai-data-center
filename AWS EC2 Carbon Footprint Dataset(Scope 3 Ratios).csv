"Manufacturing emissions for a mono socket, low DRAM, no local storage commodity rack server (kgCO?eq)",1000,Arbitrary number based on available LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) data
Commodity rack server lifespan (years),4,This is the lifespan value used in main server LCA found
Hourly manufacturing emissions conversion factor - linearly ammortised (convert to gCO?eq/hour),0.0289,Computed value to be reused to convert overall manufacturing emissions in kgCO?eq into hourly emissions in gCO?eq
DRAM Threshold to unlock additional Scope 3 emissions (GB),16,Arbitrary number based on Dell product carbon footprint documents
Manufacturing emissions for the threshold DRAM amount (kgCO?eq),22,Number based on available LCA data
Manufacturing emissions per additional CPU (kgCO?eq),100,Number based on available LCA data
Manufacturing emissions per additionnal HDD (kgCO?eq),50,Number based on available LCA data
Manufacturing emissions per additionnal SSD (kgCO?eq),100,Number based on available LCA data
Manufacturing emissions per additionnal GPU Card (kgCO?eq),150,"Arbitrary number, no precise LCA data found for GPU, estimation roughtly based on CPU and DRAM emissions"
