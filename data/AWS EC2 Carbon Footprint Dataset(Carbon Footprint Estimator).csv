,"v0.1: Initial release (September 23, 2021) 
This Spreadsheet is now deprecated => The effort is now embedded in Boavizta's work",,,,,,

,"This spreadsheet provides a way for AWS cloud users to estimate the carbon footprint of their EC2 based workloads. Two estimations are available:
- Carbon emissions related to running the instance, including the datacenter PUE
- Carbon emissions related to manufacturing the underlying hardware. Assumptions for this estimation are detailed in the ""Scope 3 Ratios"" tab",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,The methodology is detailed in several blog articles as well as on our Teads Engineering website. You can simply copy this spreadsheet to play with the data. Please comment if you spot an issue.,,,,,,

,"How to use the estimator:
Select an instance, an AWS region and input a number of compute hours to get a carbon footprint estimation of the workload.",,,,,,
